{
  "#1 - Outpaint": "Extend the edges of the image to create a larger scene while maintaining the original style, perspective, colors, lighting, and textures. Add natural and seamless background or environmental elements that perfectly match the existing photo. The expansion must look invisible and coherent with the original framing. Photorealistic, high-resolution result with natural lighting, realistic textures, and authentic visual continuity.",

  "#2 - Remove Object": "Remove the specified object completely from the scene (e.g., trash can on the left side, distracting sign behind the subject). Fill the empty area with natural background elements that match the surroundings exactly, including consistent lighting, shadows, colors, and textures. The edit must be seamless and invisible, preserving all other subjects and details in high-resolution photorealistic quality.",

  "#3 - Photo Restoration": "Restore this old or damaged photograph by removing scratches, dust, stains, tears, and noise. Repair faded colors, enhance contrast, and rebalance lighting while preserving all original subjects, facial features, and details accurately. Maintain a natural and realistic appearance with authentic textures and shadows. Output a high-resolution photorealistic image that looks freshly captured without altering the original scene.",

  "#4 - Cinematic Portrait": "Create a cinematic portrait while keeping the exact facial features intact. Use intense cinematic lighting with sharp contrast, captured from a subtle low angle to accentuate the jawline and neck. The subject should exude dominance and sculptural elegance. The background must be a saturated crimson red, strongly contrasting with the subject’s radiant skin and dark clothing. Highly stylized yet realistic.",

  "#5 - 3x3 Grid Portrait": "Generate a 3x3 grid of portraits of the same subject. Each frame should feature a different facial expression, angle, outfit, or minor styling variation. Every portrait must have a unique pose and be placed in a distinct environment. Use rich, colorful details and balanced lighting to highlight visual diversity while maintaining consistency in identity and realism.",

  "#6 - Custom Figure": "Create a realistic 1/7 scale commercial figure of the character from the illustration. Place the figure on a computer desk, standing on a circular transparent acrylic base with no text. On the computer screen, display the ZBrush modeling process of the figure. Next to the screen, include a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork. High-detail, realistic materials and lighting.",

  "#7 - Couple Polaroid": "Simulate a photo taken with a polaroid camera. Maintain the look of an authentic instant photograph with slight blur, harsh flash lighting, and natural imperfections. Keep both faces exactly the same without alteration. Replace only the background with white curtains featuring a soft sky-blue gradient. Apply the specified gestures and expressions while preserving realistic proportions and natural interaction.",

  "#8 - Ghostface 90s Scene": "A dreamy 90s-style cinematic portrait of a woman lying on shiny pink satin bedding, holding a large 90s corded phone in a thoughtful, daydreaming pose. Long wavy hair with gold butterfly clips, delicate gold jewelry, chunky rings, and simple glamorous makeup. The room is girly with 90s posters, a bowl of popcorn, and vintage magazines. The lighting is dim, grainy, and nostalgic. In the background, a Ghostface mask from the movie Scream stands partially visible in a dark doorway, ominous and cinematic, enhancing tension while maintaining a retro 90s aesthetic."
